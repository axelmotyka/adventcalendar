    * _getName()_ => returns Lastname, Firstname as String
    * _getStartingNumber()_ => returns the starting number as an int
    * _toString()_ => generates a String like '(1) Joe Cewl' 
 2. Define Class `Vehicle` with following  methods:
    * _getManufacturer()_ - returns the manufacturer like 'Skoda' as String
    * _getName()_ - returns the vehicle name like 'Fabia' as String
    * _getHorsepower()_ - returns the engines horsepower as int
    * _getEngineType_ - returns one of `[electric, diesel, gasoline]` as an Enum
    * _toString()_ - returns the vehicle as String like 'Skoda Fabia, gasoline, 25hps'
 3. Add useful unit tests
 4. Visualize created classes with plantuml as class diagram, inclusive associations.
