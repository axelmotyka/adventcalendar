 * Closest Enemy
 * Write a small calculator application, which takes a String and computes the result.
 * The following arithmetic operations are allowed: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^2(x)` and `sqr(x)`.
 * Check the right order by using parentheses. 
 * The result should be rounded off to the second decimal place.
 * The input are Strings like this:
 *  `"1+1"` = `2`
 *  `"10 * 20 + 30"` = `230`
 *  `"10 * (20 + 30)"`= `500`
 *  ... complete the tests!
